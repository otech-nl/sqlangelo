Welcome to Flask SQLAngelo's documentation!
===========================================

   :caption: Contents:

    SQLAlchemy with defaults and sugar.

Intention
==========

SQLalchemy is a powerful ORM, but highly technical. It could do with some sensible defaults and some syntactic sugar. This is what SQLAngelo provides.

Dependencies
==============

1. SQLAngelo uses `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/>`_ for package management.
2. SQLAngelo uses `Flask-SQLAlchemy <http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org>`_ as a base. This implicitly imports Flask into your project.

Test
===========

1. run `pipenv shell`
2. run `pipenv install -e .`


Indices and tables

* :ref:`modindex`
