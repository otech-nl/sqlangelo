SQLAngelo
#######

    SQLAlchemy with defaults and sugar.

Intention
==========

SQLalchemy is a powerful ORM, but highly technical. It could do with some sensible defaults and some syntactic sugar. This is what SQLAngelo provides.

Test
===========

1. run `pipenv shell`
2. run `pipenv install -e .`
